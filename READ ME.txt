R Module Project: Decoding Red and White Wine Quality

ABSTRACT

This project is aimed to assess wine quality based on different variables that are involved during the production. The study distinguishes between red and white wines, investigating the positive and negative influences of specific factors on their quality. To accomplish this, the skills and tools acquired from the R coding course will be involved.

The primary goal will be to verify that red wines demonstrate superior qualities when characterized by higher acidity, while white wines are better when possessing lower acidity levels and a sweeter taste profile. In light of these, the variables that affect positively a high-quality wine will be determined for both types: red and white wines.

Keywords: wine, quality, attributes, acidity, sweetness, pH
